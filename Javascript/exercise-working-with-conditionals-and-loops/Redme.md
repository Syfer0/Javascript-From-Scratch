# Exercise: Working with conditionals and loops

## Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will create the code for a `for loop`, using the counter variable named `i` starting from `1`.

To make the counter increment by 1 on each loop, you will use `i++`.

The exit condition for the for loop is `i<=10`.

Inside the loop, write an if-else statement, which will check the following conditions:
1. First, it will check if the value of _`i`_ is _`1`_. If it is, your code will console log the string _`"Gold medal"`_.

2. Next, I will check if the value of _`i`_ is _`2`_. If it is, your code will console log the string _`"Silver medal"`_.

3. Then, your code will check if the value of _`i`_ is _`3`_. If it is, it will console log the string _`"Bronze medal"`_.

4. For all the remaining values of _`i`_, your code will console log just the value of _`i`_.

__Note:__ The expected console log of the entire code should be as follows.
```
Gold medal
Silver medal
Bronze medal
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## Exercise 2

Use the completed code from the previous task, but convert the conditionals to a switch statement.
When you code the solution, the output in the console should remain exactly the same as in the previous question.

__Note:__ You'll need three separate cases for the three medals, and a default case for all other values of the i variable.
