# Exercise: Repetitive tasks with loops

In this exercise, you will practice writing `"for"` and `"while"` loops.

## Task 1
Write a `"for"` loop that will perform exactly the same repetitive code as this:
```javascript
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.log(3)
console.log(4)
console.log(5)
console.log('Counting completed!')
```

## Task 2 
Write a `"for"` loop that will perform exactly the same repetitive code as this:
```javascript
console.log(5)
console.log(4)
console.log(3)
console.log(2)
console.log(1)
console.log('Countdown finished!')
```

## Task 3
Write a `"while"` loop that will perform exactly the same repetitive code as this:
```javascript
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.log(3)
console.log(4)
console.log(5)
console.log('Counting completed!')
```
__Note:__ Name your increment variable `i`. Update the variable in the while loop using `i++`.

## Task 4
Write a `"while"` loop that will perform exactly the same repetitive code as this:
```javascript
console.log(5)
console.log(4)
console.log(3)
console.log(2)
console.log(1)
console.log('Countdown finished!')
```
__Note:__ In the while loop, decrement the value of `i` using: `i = i - 1`.

## Task 5
Write a `"while"` loop that will perform exactly the same repetitive code as this:
```javascript
console.log(2018)
console.log(2019)
console.log(2020)
console.log(2021)
console.log(2022)
```
