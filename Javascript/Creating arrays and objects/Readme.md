# Exercise: Creating arrays and objects

In this exercise lab you will practice creating arrays and objects.

## Tasks to complete

1. Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable `clothes`.

2. Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the `push()` method.

3. Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the `pop()` method.

4. Add a new piece of clothing using the `push()` method.

5. Use `console.log` to show the third item from the `clothes` array in the console.

6. Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable `favCar`.

7. Using the dot notation, assign a `color` property to the `favCar` object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.

8. Using the dot notation, assign a `covertible` property to the `favCar` object and give it a boolean value of your choice.

9. Use the console to log the entire `favCar` object.
