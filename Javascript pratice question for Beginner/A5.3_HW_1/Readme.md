### 1.1:

Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers `n` and `m` as input and prints all numbers from 1 to `n` in a pattern, where the numbers divisible by `m` are separated by hyphen `(-)`. Take n as 9 and m as 4.

```jsx
1234-5678-9
```

### 1.2:

Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers `n` and `m` as input and prints all numbers from 1 to `n` in two lines, where the first line contains numbers divisible by `m` separated by space, and the second line contains numbers not divisible by `m` separated by space. Take n as 20 and m as 6.

```jsx
Divisible by 6: 6 12 18 
Not divisible by 6: 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 19 20
```

### 1.3:

Write a JavaScript function named `printDivisibleNumbersBetween` that takes three numbers `p`, `n`, and `m` as input. Checks if `p` is smaller than `n` , and `n` is smaller than `m`. If yes, it should print all numbers between `n` and `m` that are divisible by `p`. Take p as 3, n as 5 and m as 15.
