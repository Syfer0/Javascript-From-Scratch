### 1.1:

Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers `n` and `m` as input and prints all numbers from 1 to `n` in a pattern, where the numbers divisible by `m` are separated by percentage `(%)`. Take n as 20 and m as 5.

```jsx
12345%678910%1112131415%1617181920
```

### 1.2:

Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers `n` and `m` as input and prints all numbers from 10 to `n` in two lines, where the first line contains numbers divisible by `m` separated by space, and the second line contains numbers not divisible by `m` separated by space. Take n as 30 and m as 5.

```jsx
Divisible by 5: 10 15 20 25 30 
Not divisible by 5: 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29
```

### 1.3:

Write a JavaScript function named `printEvenNumbersBetween` that takes three numbers `p`, `n`, and `m` as input. Checks if `p` is greater than `n` , and `n` is smaller than `m`. If yes, it should print all numbers between `p` and `m` that are even. Take p as 8, n as 5 and m as 15.
```jsx
8
