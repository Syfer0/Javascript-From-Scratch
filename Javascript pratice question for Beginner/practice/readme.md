## JavaScript Basic Questions

1. **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for adding interactivity and enhancing user experience on websites. It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server.

2. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**
JavaScript has several built-in data types, including:
   - **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
   - **Number**: Represents numeric values.
   - **Boolean**: Represents the logical values of true or false.
   - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   - **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values.

3. **What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?**
The double equals (`==`) operator in JavaScript compares two values for equality, performing type coercion if necessary. For example, `"1" == 1` would evaluate to `true` because the string "1" is coerced into the number 1. On the other hand, the triple equals (`===`) operator checks for both value and type equality. It does not perform type coercion. Using `===` is generally considered safer and recommended for most cases.

4. **What is the difference between var, let, and const?**
   - **var**: Declaring a variable with `var` has function scope. It can be redeclared and updated within its scope. It is also hoisted to the top of its scope.
   - **let**: Declaring a variable with `let` has block scope. It can be updated within its scope but cannot be redeclared in the same scope. It is not hoisted.
   - **const**: Declaring a variable with `const` also has block scope, but it cannot be updated or redeclared after initialization. It is not hoisted.

5. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**
The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a reference to the current execution context, which can vary depending on how a function is called. It allows access to properties and methods within the current object or context. The value of `this` is determined dynamically at runtime. In a global scope, `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` object in browsers), and in the context of an object method, `this` refers to the object on which the method is being called.
