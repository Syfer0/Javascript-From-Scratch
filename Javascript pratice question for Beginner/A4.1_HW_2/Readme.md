Call the function to see the expected output on the console.

```
Expected Output: 
Hey there, Sam! You are running out of storage.
```

### 1.2

$$Congratulations! You won a lottery.$$
```

### 1.3

Create a function called `concatenateKeywords` that takes two arguments called `keyword1` and `keyword2`. Inside the function, concatenate `keyword1` and `keyword2` together with a hyphen (`-`) in between. Return the resulting string.

```
Expected output:
if-else
```

### 1.4

Create a function called `showTertiaryColors` that takes six arguments called `color1` , `color2` , `color3`, `color4`, `color5` and `color6`. Inside the function, concatenate two colors to form 6 pairs of tertiary colors with a hyphen (-) in between. The pairs should be separated by comma.

Return the tertiary colors in the following format - “Six Tertiary Colors: {color1-color2}, {color3-color2}, {color3-color4}, {color5-color4}, {color5-color6}”. 

Call the function with six arguments (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet) and console.log the returned string.

```
Expected Output:
Six Tertiary Colors: Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, Blue-Violet, Red-Violet
```

## exercise 2

### 2.1

Create a function called `decrementAgeBy10` that takes one argument called `age`. Inside the function, decrement 10 from the `age` argument and return the decremented age. Call the function with an argument (35) and console.log the result.

```
Expected Output:
25
```

### 2.2

Create a function called `getRemainder` that takes two arguments called `num1` and `num2`. Inside the function, calculate the remainder by using the modulo operator. Return the remainder. Call the function with two arguments (10 and 3) and console.log the result.

```
Expected Output:
1
```

### 2.3

Create a function called `calculateTotalPrice` that takes two arguments called `price` and `quantity` . Inside the function, calculate the product of the price and quantity to get the total price. Return the total price. Call the function with two arguments (120 and 10) and console.log the result.

```
Expected Output:
1200
```

### 2.4

Create a function called `calculateTotalAmount` that takes four arguments called `price1` , `price2`, `quantity1` and `quantity2` . Inside the function, calculate the product of the price1 and quantity1 and add it to the product of price2 and quantity2 to get the total amount. Return the total amount. 

Call the function with four arguments (price 1 as 120 , price2 as 150, quantity1 as 10 and quantity2 as 15) and console.log the result.
